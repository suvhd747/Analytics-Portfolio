# Valorant Champions 2022 Exploratory Data Analysis
Source code and data files for my exploratory data analysis project in analyzing the least and most balanced maps during the culminating tournament of the 2022 Valorant Champions Tour, based on team map picks, bans, attack and defense success rates and more. 

Data was scraped from [Liquipedia Valorant](https://liquipedia.net/valorant/VCT/2022/Champions), a database that collects and stores player and tourney data and statistics. Code for scraping was adapted from [here](https://github.com/MohammedAl-Rasheed/Valorant-Masters-2021---Data-Science) and updated code is included above.
